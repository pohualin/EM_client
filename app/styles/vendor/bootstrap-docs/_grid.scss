Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that
appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.
It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful
mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

## Introduction

Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and
columns that house your content. Here's how the Bootstrap grid system works:

*   Rows must be placed within a `.container` (fixed-width) or `.container-fluid` (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.
*   Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
*   Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
*   Predefined grid classes like `.row` and `.col-xs-4` are available for quickly making grid layouts. Less mixins can also be used for more semantic layouts.
*   Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via `padding`. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on `.row`s.
*   The negative margin is why the examples below are outdented. It's so that content within grid columns is lined up with non-grid content.
*   Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three `.col-xs-4`.
*   If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.
*   Grid classes apply to devices with screen widths greater than or equal to the breakpoint sizes, and override grid classes targeted at smaller devices. Therefore, e.g. applying any `.col-md-*` class to an element will not only affect its styling on medium devices but also on large devices if a `.col-lg-*` class is not present.

```html_example
<!-- Stack the columns on mobile by making one full-width and the other half-width -->
<div class="row show-grid">
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">.col-xs-12 .col-md-8</div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>
</div>

<!-- Columns start at 50% wide on mobile and bump up to 33.3% wide on desktop -->
<div class="row show-grid">
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>
  <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4">.col-xs-6 .col-md-4</div>
</div>

<!-- Columns are always 50% wide, on mobile and desktop -->
<div class="row show-grid">
  <div class="col-xs-6">.col-xs-6</div>
  <div class="col-xs-6">.col-xs-6</div>
</div>
```
