#Welcome

This style guide is automatically generated by comments in the CSS using a tool
called [hologram](http://trulia.github.io/hologram).

The goal of hologram is to make it easy to document your CSS and to
display the code examples to use that CSS. Hologram has no
opinions about how you should actually organize/style your style guide.
You could do everything as a single file with no header/footer and it
would work just fine. Or, you could break it up into an individual file
for each component. Top navigation, left navigation, no
navigation....that's up to you. Build it however you'd like.  

##To Run

Make sure you have Ruby installed.
- run `gem install hologram` (may need to run under `sudo`)
- run `hologram`

The updated or new style guide should get generated in the `styleguide` directory.

Please see the `hologram_config.yml` for configuration options.
